These are the projects that im working on with the idea in mind. First we have this portfolio which is a window into my skill and abilities, all of them self taught. Second is an service called OneGoal. It`s a goal organization , visualization and completion app that lets you make the perfect plan and achieve any goal. Next is an ecommerce platform Haggler. It is used as a Method of price discovery, or figuring out what someone is going to pay for an item and who is going to get it. Since you donâ€™t know the item`s worth, its value is determined by what people are willing to pay for it. And last is a social support network for people with severe medical conditions who can explore a new type of medicine called Grasesry.</p>
